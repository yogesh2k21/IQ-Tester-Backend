## What we have Developed üî®‚öíÔ∏è

For students and contestants, we have developed a mobile application using React Native -> [Application Github Link](https://github.com/yogesh2k21/IQ-Tester-Frontend), a popular cross-platform mobile app development framework. By leveraging React Native, we are able to create a highly responsive and interactive mobile app that works seamlessly on both iOS and Android platforms. React Native also offers a range of customizable features and native-like performance, making it an ideal framework for creating the IQ Tester mobile app. With our React Native-based mobile app, participants can easily and conveniently take part in quizzes from their smartphones, making it more accessible and user-friendly.

For quiz hosts or teachers, we have developed a web portal using Django, a popular Python-based web development framework. Our web portal is accessible from any web browser, making it easy to use and accessible from any device. Using the web portal, quiz hosts can easily create and customize quizzes, upload questions, and set up multiple-choice questions. They can also manage the quiz in real-time, including starting and ending the quiz, tracking participants' progress, and viewing quiz results even after Quiz Ends. With our Django-based web portal, quiz hosts can conduct quizzes seamlessly and efficiently, making it an ideal tool for use in schools, colleges, and contests.

## How its Works üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The quiz application has two modes: automatic and custom. In the automatic mode, there is no limit to the number of participants and questions are read and thrown from an Excel sheet. The host selects the questions and the questions are sent to the participants' phones in real-time. 

In the custom mode,there is a limit of 5 participants, and the host needs to wait until all 5 participants are connected before sending questions and after everyone connected host has to thrown manually by typing them into the web portal. In both modes, the participants can answer multiple-choice questions in real-time and see their results as the quiz progresses. The application is user-friendly, accessible from any device, and employs the latest security protocols to ensure a secure and reliable experience.

##  Requirements üèóÔ∏è

Requirements to run our e-commerce platform:

- Docker installed on your system
- At least 4 GB of RAM available
- A web browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge
- A stable internet connection

Note: The application has been tested on Linux and macOS, but it should also run on Windows with Docker installed. The required packages and dependencies are included in the Docker containers, so you do not need to install anything manually on your system.

## Installation & Setup üè≠

To set up and install our containerized IQ Tester backend using Docker, follow these steps:

- Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine
- Navigate to the project directory
- Run the following command to build the Docker containers: `docker-compose build`
- Start the containers using the following command: `docker-compose up`
- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the e-commerce platform.

Note: The entire application has been containerized using Docker, ensuring that the application is portable and can be easily deployed on any system with Docker installed. If you make any changes to the code, you may need to rebuild the containers and restart the application. You can do this by running the `docker-compose down` command followed by `docker-compose up`.

## Hosting & Deployment ‚òÅÔ∏è

This IQ Tester platform's backend has been hosted on Amazon EC2 as part of my journey to learn about AWS and containerized using Docker.
By using Docker, the application has been packaged into a container that can be easily moved between development, testing, and production environments.
AWS provides a wide range of cloud computing services, and hosting this application on EC2 has been a great opportunity to dive deeper into the platform. 
By hosting on EC2, I was able to gain hands-on experience with cloud computing and improve my skills in this area.
